            >Professor Willem Adolf Landman is a full professor in Meteorology
            in the Department of Geography, Geoinformatics and Meteorology (GGM)
            in the Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. He has worked
            in meteorology for more than three decades and has been associated
            with the Department as an extraordinary professor since 2005. Before
            joining the Department in 2016, he first served as Chief Scientist
            at the South African Weather Service, and then as Chief Researcher
            at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Since
            joining GGM, he has been the project leader or co-leader of the
            following: a National Research Foundation project (Global Change
            Grand Challenge) on knowledge application for the management of
            extreme climate events; an Alliance for Collaboration on Climate and
            Earth Systems Science (ACCESS) project investigating the
            predictability of seasonal anomalies for societal benefit; a Water
            Research Commission project on research-based assessment of
            integrated approaches to nature-based solutions, focusing on
            seasonal predictions system development for Vaal Dam management; an
            ACCESS-JST (Japan Science and Technology Agency) project on early
            warning systems for infectious diseases; and a Belmont Forum project
            addressing southern Africa’s hydro-economy and water security.</span
          >
          <span
            >Since joining the Department, he has published more than 30 journal
            papers and has been recognised by the NRF for his invaluable
            contribution to the development of operational seasonal forecasting
            in South and southern Africa. His work has impacted specific
            applications of seasonal forecasting, such as hydrology,
            agriculture, and health in the region. In 2017, he established an
            operational seasonal forecasting entity at UP called Seasonal
            Forecast Worx, through which seasonal forecasts for southern Africa
            are distributed. These forecasts include rainfall and temperature
            forecasts for the region, malaria forecasts for the Limpopo
            Province, dry-land crop-yield and rainfall forecasts for a number of
            farms in South Africa and Namibia, inflow forecasts for Lake Kariba,
            and downstream forecasts for the Vaal Dam. Monthly forecasts of El
            Niño and La Niña events are also provided and are included in the
            ensemble of El Niño-Southern Oscillation forecasts administered by
            the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, which
            is part of the Columbia Climate School in New York, USA.</span

            Prof. Jerry John Kponyo is an Associate Professor in the Department
            of Electrical/Electronic Engineering and currently the Dean of
            Quality Assurance and Planning Unit, KNUST. He is the team leader of
            the College Innovation Center and previously served as the Head of
            the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of the College
            of Engineering. His research focuses on applying intelligent systems
            and computer models in the area of wireless communication to solve
            real-life problems. He has done research on applying artificial
            intelligence to Vehicular Ad hoc Networks, where knowledge of the
            behaviour of ants as they search for food is applied to solve a
            traffic problem. In the area of information dissemination in
            Vehicular Networks, he has developed a Minimum Spanning Tree
            clustering algorithm which substantially reduces the traffic
            overhead as far as information sharing in vehicles is concerned. He
            has worked on an emergency call routing scheme for disaster
            management in which he proposes an algorithm which gives priority to
            distressed calls from emergency situations and as a result reducing
            the response time in emergency situations.
          </span>
          <span>
            In the area of wireless communication, he has worked on the
            development of circularly polarized slot antennas for multiband
            applications. Together with other collaborators, he has worked on
            the possibility of using the orbital angular momentum of the EM wave
            for information transmission. The preliminary results have shown
            this to be possible and this has the potential of solving the
            problem of bandwidth limitation in the wireless band. His current
            works include precision agriculture using IoT, applying the Internet
            of Things (IoT) and Light Fidelity (LiFi) to Vehicular Networks as
            well as IoT security. He has published over forty research articles
            in refereed journals and conferences. He has also served on the
            Technical Planning Committee (TPC) of several reputable
            International Conferences. Prof. Kponyo has been a Visiting Lecturer
            on the MIS postgraduate programme in ESIGELEC France for the past
            three years. He is an active member of the Institution of Electrical
            and Electronic Engineers as well as the Ghana Institution of
            Engineers.

      <span class="background-description"
        >Africa is one of the continents threatened by climate change and other
        global challenges that needs a transdisciplinary approach to tackle the
        problem and adapt for sustainable development. Rising temperatures and
        extreme weather events are threatening the health and food security of
        humans in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Future Africa Research Leadership
        Fellowship (FAR-LeaF) programme aims to develop leaders with
        transdisciplinary skills for application oriented research that can help
        tackle the challenges of the continent. The FAR-LeaF programme funds
        postdoctoral research projects and offers a mentoring platform for
        fellows career and personal development. Development of
        transdisciplinarity skills of researchers is urgent and critical. The
        current trend of impactful research demands the involvement of more than
        one discipline and stakeholders to achieve the expected outcome. Moreso,
        the emerging challenges such as climate change are global and
        transboundary and can only be effectively addressed using
        transdisciplinary approach. There is a gap in the transition of
        institutions in Africa from Multidisciplinary research to
        transdisciplinary research, which FAR-LeaF is working to bridge the gap.
        The three-day training workshop will introduce early career researchers
        on strategies of developing a transdisciplinarity collaborative approach
        in research. It is obvious, that a lot of young career researcher are
        lost, and would hardly find their foothold on any career projectile. The
        workshop will leverage on the expertise of mentors and supervisors to
        aid participants to develop career plans, enhance their presentation and
        writing skills, deliberate on pathways to move research to action that
        addresses the challenges of the African continent.</span
